## 🗄 Data Modeling & SQL Workflow

The dataset was structured using a star schema design in PostgreSQL.

### Database Design
- Fact Table: `public_fact_sales_star`
- Dimension Tables:
  - `public_dim_customers`
  - `public_dim_products`
  - `public_dim_dates`

### SQL Transformations
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Aggregation logic for sales and profit calculations
- Revenue bucket classification for customer segmentation
- Discount calculations and category-level performance evaluation

The structured schema enabled efficient DAX calculations and scalable reporting.
All SQL scripts used for schema creation, transformations, and analytical queries are available in the `/sql` directory of this repository.

## 📐 DAX & Analytical Modeling

The dashboard leverages custom DAX measures to calculate KPIs, customer segmentation logic, and profitability metrics.

### Key Measures Implemented

- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin %  
- Avg Revenue per Customer  
- Loss-Making Customers %  
- Customer Margin %

### Advanced Calculations

- Dynamic segment-level margin evaluation
- Top N customer ranking by profit
- Conditional formatting for margin performance
- Discount impact analysis using combined measures

All measures were designed to support business-driven insights rather than simple aggregations.
